# Quicksort and Optimization
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This project implemented 3 variation of quicksort algorithms. The first one used last item as the pivot. The second used median as the pivot by applying randomized selection algorithm. The third one also used median as the pivot, while, it applied deterministic (Median of the medians algorithm) selection to get the median. Number of comparisons and total running time are being compared.
