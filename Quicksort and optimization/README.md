# Quicksort and Optimization
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This project implements matrix multiplication in Java by using regular matrix multiplication algorithm and Schönhage–Strassen's algorithm. Two input Matrices are generated with random numbers. In my program, I used 0-9 digits. The running time of these two algorithms (theoretical or actual) is being compared.
