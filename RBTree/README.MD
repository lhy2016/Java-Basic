<h3>Red Black Binary Search Tree</h3>
<p>This project implements a red black tree. Generic data type is used. 
Every time a new node is inserted into the RBT, a fixup algorithm fix the tree starting from current Node recursively, 
to ensure that the tree is always balanced, which means the longest path from the root to a leaf cannot be 
more than twice of the shortest path from the root to a leaf.</p>
